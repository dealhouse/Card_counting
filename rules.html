    <li>The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and suits don’t matter:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.</li>
    <li>Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.</li>
    <li>Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.</li>
</ol>
